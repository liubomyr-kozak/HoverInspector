# HoverInspectorSupport

### Introduction
Welcome to HoverInspectorSupport, a game-changing Chrome extension designed for designers, QA, and developers alike. Mimicking the display dimension between selected and hovered elements, HoverInspectorSupport emulates tools found in platforms like Zeplin and Figma, offering a more interactive and efficient design inspection experience directly in your browser.
